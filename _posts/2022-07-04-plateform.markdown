**This project aimed to designed and build the Stewart Platform — the parallel robots capable of high-precision manipulation to assemble the structure automatically in uncertain environments (e.g. the lunar or Martian surface) by collaborative robotic agents.**

- Designed the Stewart Platform — the parallel robots capable of high-precision manipulation.
- Build a closed-loop control system for position calibration using vision sensors.
